There are some basic programming concepts in OOP:
  The abstraction is simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem. 
  The polymorphism is the process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input. 
  The encapsulation hides the implementation details of a class from other objects. 
  The inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined.

An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.

* It is a convention to give classes a name that starts with a capital letter.

Inside a class, we can define attributes and methods. Technically, attributes are variables and methods are functions defined inside a class.
	An attribute is a characteristic of an object. This can be for example a salary of an employee. 
	A method defines operations that we can perform with our objects. A method might define a cancellation of an account.

A special method called __init__() is used to initialize an object.
* Attributes are set in the __init__() method.
Each method in a class definition begins with a reference to the instance object. It is by convention named self. There is nothing special about the self name. 
The second parameter is the argument. The value is passed during the class initialization.
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name
