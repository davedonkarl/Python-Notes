There are some basic programming concepts in OOP:
The abstraction is simplifying complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem. 
The polymorphism is the process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input. 
The encapsulation hides the implementation details of a class from other objects. 
The inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined.
